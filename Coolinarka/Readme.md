Hi. This is my project for this class. 

- SQL dump is called Coolinarka dump and import it as you would any SQL dump. Check where is database ran and that good stuff. 

- Frontend folder has all the frontend files I made while making this project. Then frontend was built into production and was brought to backend. 

- Backend is all you practicaly need. It has frontend in public/app/dist folder built for production. Just run it with node server.js and you're good to go.

- There is also a video demo of the web app :)

Web app is made with Angular for frontend and Node.js for backend with SQL database as a database for all the data :)
